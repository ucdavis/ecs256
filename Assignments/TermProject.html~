ECS 256 Term Project 
</h1>


<b>DIRECTIONS</b>
<blockquote>

<UL>

<li> 
Due Sunday, Dec. 4, 11:59 pm.
</li> </p> 

<li> 
Submit to my <b>handin</b> site on CSIF (NOT the TAs' sites), username 
<b>matloff</b>, directory <b> 256project</b>.  
</li> </p> 

<li> 
In order to be sure to at least get some work submitted before 
the deadline, it's best that you submit multiple times, as
your report becomes more complete.  Each submission will overwrite the
last.
</li> </p> 

<li> 
A written report, in LaTeX, is required, along with all R code, graphics
files (must be generated by R) and so on.  You must include both the LaTeX and
graphics files that produced your report AND the PDF output file.
</li> </p> 

<li> Your LaTeX file must be named <b>ProjectReport.tex</b>, and the
corresponding PDF <b>ProjectReport.pdf</b>.  The grading script will
look for these; don't disappoint the grading script!
</li> </p>

<li> The name of your submitted file must
be of the form <b> email1.email2....tar </b>, where each
<b>emaili</b> is the UCD e-mail address of group
member i, e.g. <b> bclinton.gwbush.bobama.dtrump.tar</b>.
Note the periods separating fields.  Don't get the address wrong!
Otherwise the grading script may not give someone credit.
</li> </p>

<li>  Your <b>.tar</b> file must contain only regular files, NO
SUBDIRECTORIES!!!!  
</li> </p> 

<li> 
And <b>.tar</b> does NOT mean <b>.tar.gz</b> or
<b>.tar.bz2</b> (or for that matter <b>.rar</b>, which one student used
once).  The grading script will execute
</p>

<pre>
tar xf youraddresses.tar  # unpack
ls ProjectReport.tex ProjectReport.pdf  # check for proper files
xpdf ProjectReport.pdf  # view PDF
</pre>

<p> Note that the script will NOT do <b>cd</b>.
</li> </p>

<li> Place all your code in a file <b>TermProject.R</b>, <i>as well
as</i> in an Appendix to your report (LaTeX <b> \appendix
\section{}</b>).
I may execute your code, so make sure it is runnable.
</li> </p>

<li> <b>HUGELY IMPORTANT--DON'T FORGET THIS!</b> Include a section 
in your report with one subsection for each team member.  The subsection
title should indicate the member's name, e.g. "Participation by Mary
Smith," and should be fairly detailed as to what Mary's contribution to
the project effort entailed.  <b>Don't forget this section!</b>
</li> </p>

<li> 
Writing must be clear, and <i>up to the standards of the profession:</i>
Clear, engaging writing, using correct grammar.  Writing need not 
(and should not) be pretentious, but avoid being too colloquial ("the mean was 
kinda low").  Presentation need not be fancy, but graphs and 
tables should be used to illustrate all numerical results.
If your team discussed multiple approaches, briefly describe the
alternate plans that you chose not to pursue.
</li> </p> 

<li> Groups that put in a reasonable amount of time--and thought!--
almost always receive an A or A+ grade on the project.  (Individual 
grades may possibly be affected by the amount each team member
contributed, but it is extremely rare for different members of a team to
get different Project grades, unlike the Homework situation.)  As
explained earlier, 
<b>
your Project grade may have a major impact on your
course grade, e.g. a B grade becoming A-.

<b>Problem A:</b>

<p>
Here we will model a health maintenance organization (HMO) advice system.
Nurses field calls from patients, who describe their symptoms.  Advice
might be to, say monitor the situation for another day, make an
appointment with a physician or whatever.  Here are the variables
(note: probability convention is capital letters for random variables)
and parameters (lower-case).
</p>

<UL>

<li> There is a virtual waiting room, i.e. the queue, 
accommodating a maximum of m patients.  The number currently waiting is K.  
</li> </p>

<li> The number of nurses N will vary in time from 0 to n, as follows:
</p>

<p>

If upon completion of a phone call, there are 0 patients waiting in the
queue, the number of nurses will be reduced by 1 (with a minimum of 0).  
If a patient arrival occurs at the time the queue is full, either 1 
new nurse will be added (with a maximum of n), with probability 
p, or the call will be terminated, with an apology to the patient.

</li> </p>

<li> Call duration is exponentially distributed with mean &mu;.
</li> </p> 

<li> Intercall arrival time is exponentially distributed with mean &nu;.
</li> </p> 

<li> 

If the number in the waiting room drops below r, the number of
advice nurses will be reduced by 1 (but not to 0).  If the 
number exceeds s, an extra advice nurse will be added.
</li> </p>

</UL>

<p>
Using parameter values, and especially success 
criteria, of your choice, investigate the effects of 
varying the parameters.  
</p>


<b>Problem B:</b>

<p>
Here you will explore the value of using the Method of Stages (MoS) to
circumvent the restriction that event times in continuous-time Markov
chains must have exponential distributions.  The method itself is
described in the blog post of Oct. 28, 1625.
</p>

<p>
The question you will address is simple:
</p>

<blockquote>

Is the MoS an accurate and feasible approach to the problem of
nonexponential distributions in Markov chains?

</blockquote>

<p>
This problem is highly open-ended.  Make sure to stick to this central
issue, though:  How well does the MoS work for Markov chains?  Do not
simply investigate the question of whether the MoS is a good
approximation to a nonexponential distribution in its own right.
