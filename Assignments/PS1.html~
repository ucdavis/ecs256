Problem Set 1:  Review of undergraduate probability.

<h2>Due Wednesday, October 5, 11:59 pm</h2>

<UL>

<li> 
The goal of this assignment is, as noted, review, but it is required and
will count in your course grade, just like any other assignment.  Note
that the material on iterated expectation is technically undergraduate
level, but is more sophisticted than what is usually covered at that
level.
</li> </p> 

<li> Please see our course 
<a href="../256Syllabus.html">syllabus</a> for details on writing up and
submitting your solutions.  Note in particular the requirement that
LaTeX and R must be used.

<h2>1.</h2>

<p>
Let X, X<sub>1</sub>,...,X<sub>n</sub> be independent, expponentially
distributed random variables with parameter &lambda;.  
</p>

<p> <OL type = "a">

<li> Find the median of X, i.e. a <i>number</i> m such that P(X < m) = 0.5,
in terms of &lambda;.
</li> </p> 

<li>  Let the <i>random variable</i> M =
median(X<sub>1</sub>,...,X<sub>n</sub>).
Usually computation of medians must take into account the possibility
of tied values; e.g. see
<a href="http://minato.sip21c.org/msb/man/truemedian.html">
this site.</a> But not here.  Why not?
</li> </p> 

<li> Find P(X<sub>1</sub> < 1.2 X<sub>2</sub>).
</li> </p> 

<li> Say n = 2, and that X<sub>i</sub> is exponentially distributed with
parameter &lambda;<sub>i</sub>, i = 1,2.  We choose one of the 
X<sub>i</sub> at random, with probability p<sub>i</sub>.  Let
T be the result.  Find ET and Var(T) in terms of the &lambda;s and the
p<sub>i</sub>.
</li> </p> 

</OL> </p>

<h2>2.</h2>

<p>
Say the random variable X has an exponential distribution with parameter
&lambda;.  However, our observation of it is truncated at c, so that our
observed value T is min(X,c).  Derive a formula for Var(T) as a function
of &lambda; and c, using the "Pythagorean Theorem for variance" (Law of
Total Variance, SRC p.54).  Write simulation code to verify your
formula.
</p>

<h2>3.</h2>  

<p>
The Tower Property says,
</p>


<pre>
E { [E(Y | U,V)] | U} = E(Y | U)
</pre>

<p>
Write simulation code that demonstrates this for a context in which 
E(Y | U,V) = U + V, so E(Y | U) = U + E(V|U).
</p>

<p>
A few tips:
</p>

<UL>

<li> Though this problem simply asks for a mere simulation, you probably
will find it rather challenging, and it may generate quite a bit of
discussion in your group.  As noted in the blog, I'm available for help
if you need it.
</li> </p> 

<li>
If U and/or V are continuous random variables, you'd have to evaluate
the conditional quantities with, e.g., U &asymp; u instead of U = u.
To avoid such complication, I recommend making U and V discrete.
</li> </p> 

<li> Make sure you understand the intuitive content here, with
probability and expected value being thought of as long-run frequency of
occcurrence (PSB, Sec. 2.2) and long-run average, respectively.
