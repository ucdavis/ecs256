<h2>Instructors</h2>

</UL>


<h2>Goals</h2>

<p>
To develop skills in modeling of Markov chains and other
stochastic processes, and to better understand the
modeling process itself.
</p>

<h2>Topical Coverage</h2>

<p>
See the 
<a href="Reading.html">Topic Outline and Reading List</a> 
for a detailed account.
</p>

<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

<p>
A calculus-based probability course, like STA 131A or MAT 135A.  Linear
algebra.
</p>

<p>
This is definitely a math course.  Thought we will indeed do some
coding,  
<b>
this is not a "What function should I call?" course.
</b>
</p>

<h2>Class Format</h2>

<p>
I will lecture mainly from the readings, and will begin each lecture by
saying something like "Please turn to page 88."  I will then discuss the
reading, explaining the "big picture," goals and so on.
</p>

<p>
I will generally not write on the board, nor give slide presentations.
I will often present spur-of-the-moment examples (which <i>will</i> use the
board), that arise from class discussion.  I will also frequently make
impromptu comments not in the readings.
</p>

<p>
I regard class discussion, often arising by a question raised by a
student, to be one of the most important parts of a class.
</p>

<h2>Exams</h2>

<UL>

<li> Four quizzes.  The last, held on December 2 (last day of lecture),
will be a group quiz, done collaboratively in your homework group.
</li> </p>

<li>
Open book, open notes.
</li> </p> 

<li> Exams are given through 
<a href="github.com/matloff/OMSI">OMSI.</a>.
Though it is a math course, you will use R to express your answers.
</li> </p> 

<li> <b>NOTE CAREFULLY</b> that though the readings are the primary
source, many exam questions will be based on class discussion,
definitely including my impromptu comments.
</li> </p> 

</UL>

<h2>Assignments</h2>

<UL>



<li> Approximately 3-4 problem sets.  Derivations, applications to real
data.
</li> 
</p>

<li> Term project, due on the day of the scheduled final exam.  (We do
not have an actual final.)  Workload here will be comparable to about
half a problem set.
</li>
</p>

<li> All assignments must be written up in LaTeX.  Turn in your <b>.tex</b> 
file and resulting <b>.pdf</b>, as well as any <b>.R</b> and image files
that you use.  Images must be generated from R, using either base-R,
<b>ggplot2</b> or <b>lattice.</b>  Please <b>NOTE CAREFULLY:</b>  All work must
be reproducible by me; in some cases, I may even try running your code
in somewhat different settings, to better understand what you did.
Solutions turned in to TA on CSIF, via <b>handin</b>.
</li> 
</p>

</UL>

<h2>Groups</h2>

<p>
This is a major, major issue.
</p>

<p>
You will rely quite heavily on your homework groups for problem sets,
the group quiz, and the term project.  Get to know them well!
</p>

<UL>

<li> 
Group size must be 3 or 4.  If you wish to form your own group, let the
TA know <b>during Week 1 of class.</b>  Otherwise the TA will assign you
to a group.
</li> </p> 

<li> Group work should be collaborative, not "You do Problem 1, I'll do
Problem 2 etc."
</li> </p> 

<li> Within a group, there may be differing levels of math or coding
skill, so not everyone might contribute equally.  But everyone must do
their part.  
</p>

<p>

In working with your teammates on the problem sets, and later on the term
project, you ARE part of a team, and you are expected to do your best to
contribute to the team. You cannot say, for instance, "Oh, I just want
an S grade in this course, so I will do less." 
<b>
This is unethical, irresponsible behavior toward your teammates.
</b>

</p>

<p>

If, in interactive grading, it becomes clear that you contributed little
or nothing to the team effort, <b> YOU WILL NOT GET CREDIT FOR THE
ASSIGNMENT. </b>  If this happens on multiple occasions,
<b>you will get
you a D or F for the course, regardless of your quiz grades etc.</b>
If a member of your group is not participating, notify me
<b>IMMEDIATELY.</b>
</li> </p> 

</UL>

<h2>Blog</h2>

<p>
It is required that you read the 
<a href="http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/~matloff/256/Blog.html">
course blog</a> at least once per day.  All course announcements will be
made there.  Material in blog posts may also be subject to exam
questions.
</p>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<p>
Please note that the grading of the problem sets will be
<b>INTERACTIVE.</b>  Your group will sign up for a time to come to my
office for grading, and during the grading session I will ask you
questions, <b>INDIVIDUALLY.</b>  Where does this equation come from?
What is this code doing?  If the problem prompt had been such-and-such,
how would your solution change?  I may also ask you questions on the
course material itself.
</p>

<p>
Since I do ask questions individually, it is possible that not everyone
gets the same grade within a given group on a given problem set.
</p>

<p>
I will grade the exams using the OMSI tool.
</p>

<p>
Tentatively, I expect to give 50% weight on the exams, and 50% on the
assignments (problem sets, term project).`
</p>

<h2>Final Comments</h2>

<p>
I enjoy teaching very much, and look forward to working with you.  If
you have any constructive suggestions or concerns during the 
quarter, please do not hesitate to let me know.
</p>

<p>
I've always liked the field of Markov chains.  I hope you find them
captivating too.
</p>
