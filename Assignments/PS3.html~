<h2>1.</h2>

<p>
Consider the computer worm model, Sec. 9.3.1, modified so that computers
can be DISinfected, as follows:
</p>

<p>
When a computer becomes infected, a disinfection process is started,
whose duration you will model as exponentially distributed with mean
&nu;.  All random variables involved are assumed independent.
</p>

<p>
The system will eventually reach either state 0 (no infected machines)
or state g (all machines infected).  Model both of these states as
absorbing. 
</p>

<p>
Let p<sub>i</sub> denote the probability that we reach state 0, starting
from state i, 0 < i < g.  Find a closed-form expression for p<sub>i</sub>.
</p>

<h2>2.</h2>

<p>
Here we will model a health maintenance organization (HMO) advice system.
Nurses field calls from patients, who describe their symptoms.  Advice
might be to, say monitor the situation for another day, make an
appointment with a physician or whatever.  Here are the parameters
(capital letters indicate random variables).
</p>

<UL>

<li> The number of nurses N will vary from 1 to n.
</li> </p>

<li> There is a virtual waiting room, accommodating a maximum of m
patients.  The number of currently waiting is K.  If a call arrives when
the waiting room is full, it is discarded (hlpefully with an apologetic
message).
</li> </p>

<li> Call duration is exponentially distributed with mean &mu;.
</li> </p> 

<li> Intercall arrival time is exponentially distributed with mean &nu;.
</li> </p> 

<li> If the number in the waiting room drops below r, the number of
advice nurses will be reduced by 1.  If the number exceeds s, an extra
advice nurses will be added.

</UL>

<li> Using parameter values of your choice, investigate the effects of
varying the parameters on (a) patient waiting time, (b) proportion of
blocked calls and (c) expense to the HMO in terms of the advice nurses,
who are paid by the hour.
<li> 

<li> Your writeup is required to be in LaTeX.  Your analysis should
mainly be graphical, and the graphs must be generated by R.
</li> </p> 

<h2>3.</h2>

<p>
Say X has density f<sub>X</sub>, but is sampled in a length-biased
manner, so that we observe Y, with density f<sub>Y</sub>(t) = t
f<sub>X(t)</sub> / EX.  Derive a formula for the cdf F<sub>Y</sub>, and
verify via simulation.
